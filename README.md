# JavaFX Registration Form

This project is a simple JavaFX-based registration form designed to demonstrate the use of JavaFX for building graphical user interfaces. The application includes basic functionality for user input validation and messages for registration success or failure.

---

## Features

- **User Interface**: Built using JavaFX `FXML` for a clean and interactive design.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures required fields are filled before submission.
- **Dynamic Messages**: Displays success or failure messages based on input validation.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher
- **JavaFX Library**: (If your JDK doesn't include JavaFX)

---

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/javafx-registration-form.git
   cd javafx-registration-form

Step 2: Open in an IDE
Import the project into your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
Ensure the FXML file (register.fxml) is placed in the resources folder and linked properly.

Step 3: Run the Application
Run the Main class to start the application:

javac Main.java
java Main

Code Overview
Main Application
The Main class initializes and launches the JavaFX application

public class Main extends Application {
    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception {
        Parent root = FXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource("register.fxml"));
        primaryStage.initStyle(StageStyle.UNDECORATED);
        primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(root, 600, 500));
        primaryStage.show();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(args);
    }
}

Controller Methods
The RegisterController contains the core application logic:

closeButtonOnAction: Closes the application

public void closeButtonOnAction(ActionEvent event) {
    Stage stage = (Stage) closecol.getScene().getWindow();
    stage.close();
}

submitButton: Validates user input and updates the feedback message.

public void submitButton(ActionEvent event) {
    if (idcol.getText().isBlank()) {
        registerMsg.setText("Registration Not Successful");
    } else {
        registerMsg.setText("User Registered Successfully");
    }
}
